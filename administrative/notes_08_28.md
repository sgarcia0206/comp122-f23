# Today's Material
  1. Philosophy 
     * Why Unix/Linux?  It is philosophical!
       ```
       The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, compact, clear, modular, 
       and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers 
       other than its creators.
       ```
     * Why an emphasis on collaborative tools?
       - Technological Systems are built, maintained, and deployed by teams
       - Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software 
         development that helps teams deliver
       - The Agile Manifesto 
         1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
         1. Working software over comprehensive documentation
         1. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
         1. Responding to change over following a plan
   
     * Consequences of the Agile Approach
       1. Constantly look for new processes and tools to be more effective as a team!
       1. Use documentation as a guide, don't presume the "spec" is always right -- 
          but fix it when it is wrong.
       1. Focus on current needs to solve problems, don't focus a rehashing previous
          (mis)understandings.
       1. Except what is expected to change: Improvise, Adapt, Overcome!

  1. Class Notes:
     - Markdown verses Markup
       - reference/markdown-cheat-sheet.md
     - Sublime Text
       - subl
     - Spacing and Indentation is important!
       - $ cat ../syllabus.md | sed 's/ //g' | awk '{ print $0 }' | sed '/^$/d'
       - cat
         - catenate the file ../syllabus.md onto the current file -- which is the terminal window
       - sed 's/ //g'   
         - \# stream editor (sed) command to "s"ubstitute a space with nothing, "g"lobal within the line
       - awk '{ printf $0}'
         - awk command to print out a line of text without a '\n'
         - as compared to awk '{ printf $0 "\n" }'
       - sed '/^$/d'
         - "d"elete all empty lines

  1. The Command Line Interface versus the Graphical User Interface
     - Hierarchical File System and Naming (tree)
     - Navigation: cd, pushd, popd (stack)
     - Examination: ls -lF
     - Execution:  open/start, subl
     - Modification: 
       - mkdir, touch 
       - rmdir, rm 
       - cp, mv, ln, ln -s 
     - Manual: man
