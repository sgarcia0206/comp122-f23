ARM (A32)
The standard 32-bit ARM calling convention allocates the 16 general-purpose registers as:

r15: Program counter (as per the instruction set specification).
r14: Link register. The BL instruction, used in a subroutine call, stores the return address in this register.
r13: Stack pointer. The Push/Pop instructions in "Thumb" operating mode use this register only.
r12: Intra-Procedure-call scratch register.
r4 to r11: Local variables.
r0 to r3: Argument values passed to a subroutine and results returned from a subroutine.


These names are proved by the assembler
.eqv  r0   a1
.eqv  r1   a2
.eqv  r2   a3
.eqv  r3   a4

.eqv  r12  ip   scratch ... not saved... similar to $at
.eqv  r13  sp
.eqv  r14  lr
.eqv  r15  pc
